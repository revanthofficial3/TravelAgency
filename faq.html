        </p><hr>
        <h2 class="faq_head2">HOW DO TRAVEL AGENTS GET PAID? WILL I BE CHARGED EXTRA OR WILL MY ACCOMMODATIONS HAVE AN EXTRA FEE?</h2>
        <p class="faq_para">
            We are paid by the resorts, we do not charge a service fee.  
        </p>
        <p class="faq_para">
            Many resorts have price parity, the cost is same whether you book through us, direct with the resort, or with an online booking engine. 
        </p>
        <p class="faq_para">
            The difference between using a travel agent is that we help you plan a stress-free vacation without the hassle of going it alone. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="faq_head2">
            WHY SHOULD I BOOK WITH YOU INSTEAD OF AN ONLINE BOOKING SITE, OR DIRECT WITH A RESORT?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq_para">
            With us, you get exceptional personal assistance before, during, and after your vacation.

        <p class="faq_para">
            We also arm you with your own personal 1-800 call number to call and reach us if you need something while you're away. You won't get that from a travel site.
